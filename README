COMPILING HelloOS

   In order to compile HelloOS you will need following tools:
      * Make
         Actually, you *can* compile without it, by your own
         /dev/hands.

      * GCC C-compiler
         Some parts of the code (especially inline asm) are
         gcc-specific and probably wont to compile with other
         tools. If you are able to compile HelloOS without gcc
         please let me know!

      * dev86 package (as86 and ld86)
         Bootsector if written with as86 assembler. I think it
         wont to compile with other assembler.

      To compile both the bootsector and the kernel just type:
         $ make depend
         $ make
      In result you'll receive these files:
         * boot.bin     - bootsector for FAT12-floppy
         * hello        - HelloOS' kernel
         * start        - main() function ;) (like init in linux)
         * user/        - demo binaries in this folder cat
                                 be runned with 'exe <filename>'
                                 console command under HelloOS

      If you will not run 'make depend' it'll compile anyway but
      there is can be some warnings.


INSTALLING

      To make bootable floppy image type:
         $ make image
      You will receive file 'image' with floppy image.
      To install HelloOS on floppy, insert floppy into /dev/fd0
      and type:
         $ make install
      (this command suggests that /mnt/floppy is a mount point
      for /dev/fd0)
      Your files on this floppy will NOT be erased, but it is
      a risk to destroy the filesystem if this floppy is not
      standard DOS-formatted one. See comments in boot.S (in
      russian ;) ).

WWW
      Visit our site: http://helloos.berlios.de and HelloOS'
      project page on http://developer.berlios.de/projects/helloos.
      There you can find latest releases of HelloOS, bug tracking
      system, get support and get latest testing sources snapshot
      via Subversion (SVN).
      

FEATURES

These commands are supported in the console:
   * clear     -  clears the screen (except the bottom line)

   * exe <filename> - loads specified a.out file into memory
                  and creates new process for it. See comments
                  above on what demos included in the sources.

   * info <filename> - prints headers of specified a.out-binary file

   * ps        -  lists all processes in the system

   * kill <pid> - kills process with specified PID (see 'ps' list)

   * pages <pid> - prints memory usage by process with specified PID
                  (see 'ps' list)

   * gp        -  invokes General Protection Fault in main process.
                  Main process will be killed after it.

   * beep      -  invokes a beeeep with PC-speaker. It is no
                  way to stop it.

   * cpu       -  prints some information about your CPU

   * help      -  List of other console commands
