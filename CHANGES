  HelloOS ChangeLog


CHANGES IN 0.0j:

   * System page tables now handled via binfmt.c's function add_sys_pageref()

   * User programs now can use standard C functions by linking with lib/stdio.o
      and lib/string.o.

   * a.out support has been removed

   * Syscalls are fully changed

   * User processes can use `common variables' to communicate. These can be used
      as semaphores. Implemented in ipc.c.

   * Wait functions added: wait_pid, wait_comvar. So process now have a `state':
      running or waiting.

   * Command line parameters now supported. Argc always equals to 1 and whole
      parameters are sent via argv[0].

   * Console command changed: `exe <filename> [<cmdarg>]' - run binary,
      `bg <filename> [<cmdarg>]' - run binary in background, `help' - write list
      of console commands

   * Syscalls for file-handling

   * New demo programs: ls, cat, xo

   * In several places panics were changed to killing current process



CHANGES IN 0.0i:

   * All paging-specific constants and macroses are defined in pager.h.
      Pager.c contains functions for dealing with pages, not only
      memory-manager. Added check for freeing low-memory page.

   * User processes are able to exit via sys_exit. If it returns from main()
      sys_exit will be called automatically by user_exit_code in head.S. Demo
      et.c demonstrates it.

   * New type indx_t for indexes



CHANGES IN 0.0h:

   * Support of multiple binary formats (binfmt.c). Demand loading works for
      each format.

   * Support of ELF binary format! i386-aout-gcc is not more needed to compile
      HelloOS. Start file is now compiling into ELF file.
      No dynamic linking or shared libraries are supported now for ELF, only
      static files will work. All relocation or dynamic info is ignored.
      There is common syscalls to load binaries of A.OUT and ELF formats.

   * Fixed bug: %edi and %esi registers now stored across syscalls and
      interrupts

   * New types in types.h: addr_t and offs_t are synonyms to uint. In the next
      version i'll replace uint and ulong with these types in many places in
      order to increase clearness of source code.

   * Ugly mymain.c removed. I think that in future i can remove support of
      A.OUT binaries because nobody seems to use it in the real world.




CHANGES IN 0.0g:

   * Demand loading of binary files is implemented



CHNAGES IN 0.0e:

   * All code in start.c now removed from the kernel and placed in 'start.out'
      file wich will be loaded on startup. start.out uses kernel functions via
      *ugly*and*buggy* system calls. These syscalls were added *only* to give
      opportunity to split start.c and will be completely changed next version
      of the system.

   * All interrupt vectors except IRQ0 (scheduler) are handled via
      interrupt-gates instead of task-gates

   * Add initializations (fd, fat, scrio, pager) are now called from head.S

   * All initializations now prints some messages on the screen

   * puts() now understands several metasymbols for color selection. New header
      colors.h now contains color-related constants.



CHANGES IN 0.0d:

   I decided to skip 'c' version because 90% of code is rewritten since 'b'
   version (lesser, of course, but i feel that!).


   Main changes in 0.0d:

      * Memory model is Completely Rewritten! Now it simular to windows'(r) and
         linux's model: lower 2Gb is mapped for every process personally and
         higher 2Gb is a system memory area.

      * Protection: all processes runs with CPL=3 and they cannot touch to the
         system memory and memory of another process. General protection fault
         is handled by kernel and process which invokes it will be killed.

      * Simple memory manager is implemented (pager.c). Physical memory is
         allocated page by page for new processes and freed when process
         terminates.

      * HelloOS now supports binaries in a.out-format (aout.c)! Only *static*
         zmagic binaries are supported. All relocation info and symbol table will
         be ignored. Several console commands have been added to handle
         a.out-files. See README for details.

      * System calls mechanism is implemented via 0x80 interrupt (like in linux).
         There are three simple demo syscalls and several demo binaries to use it.


   Other minor changes:

      scheduler:
         * Ugly TaskPool is removed. TSS' will be allocated in separate page when
            process starts.

      hello_stdio:
         * Fixed bug with scrolling on boot-up
         * scroll() is rewritten in asm
         * puts() and other i/o functions now handles '\t' metasymbol
         * Fixed bug in printf
         * Couple of small changes

      hello_string:
         * several functions are rewritten in asm
         * memmove added

      fd:
         * comments fixed

      panic:
         * added infinity loop for QEmu which ignores "hlt" instruction

      Makefile:
         * Dependences are now handled via gcc -M, so you need to 'make depend' before
            'make all'

      fat:
         * New LoadParts() function to load chunk of the file into the buffer

      New file head.h now contains system constants such as segment selectors, offsets
         of system structures, etc.
